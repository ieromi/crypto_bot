<h3>/start - command to start the bot and follow the instructions.</h3>
<h3>You can specify several currencies at once in one message, for example, “btc 60000 64000 eth 3000 3500”, or split it into several messages and add one at a time.</h3>
<h3>By command /list - you can see all active tracks.</h3>
<h3>The /clear command clears the list of your active tracks.</h3>
<h3>If the bot was unable to recognize a crypto by its abbreviation, an error will appear in the group chat, and the track itself will be cancelled.</h3>
